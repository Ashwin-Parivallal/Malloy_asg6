Project description: We needed to implement everything from project 5 and in addition make recursive functions work. To achieve this, I had to handle formal and actual function parameters. Then I needed to make mypy work for recursive functions. I have tested factorial and fibonacci programs and it worked.

The easiest part of this project: Mapping the formal and actual parameters.

Problems that I had in completing this project:  Again in this project, handling scope to make recursion work was difficult. 


Notes:
  1. For return statements, in my project, if the return statement is just "return" without any value, then I return a value of zero with it. Python 2.7 returns a None object in that case. The problem doesn't occur as long as we try to print a function whose return value is None. In that case python prints None and my mypy prints 0. I think we would not usually try to print a function that returns a nullptr/None.

  2. Please use the factorial and fibonacci test cases so that the result is lower than the max size of int. I think if we try to compute factorials(of numbers greater than 12) whose result is very large, some overflow occurs and the results from mypy and python 2.7 don't match.

  3. Also, I had small bugs in my project 5 which caused some test cases to fail. I have rectified those in this project.
